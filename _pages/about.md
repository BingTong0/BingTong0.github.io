I am a second-year PhD student in the joint program between [CreateLink](https://www.galaxybase.com/) and [HKUST(GZ)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Prof. Jia Li](https://sites.google.com/view/lijia).

My research interests lie in distributed graph databases, distributed graph algorithms, and graph benchmarking, with a focus on improving efficiency, scalability, and performance evaluation in large-scale graph processing systems.
